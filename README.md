### IDEA_Fleet_theme

Fleet is beautiful! Use this similar theme in IDEA or Pycharm or CLion whatever JetBrains IDE you like.

#### How to use:

1. go to `Preferences / Settings | Editor | Color Scheme`.

2. Click on the Show Scheme Actions gear icon and select Import Scheme....

3. Choose the newly converted `.icls` file.

The theme file is forked from Michaelzhouisnotwhite's VSCode
theme [Jetbrains-Fleet-Theme](https://github.com/Michaelzhouisnotwhite/Jetbrains-Fleet-Theme/tree/main), and using
emiliadecaudin's [colorSchemeTool](https://github.com/emiliadecaudin/colorSchemeTool/tree/master) to make the
VSCode theme to JetBrains theme, much appreciated to you!
