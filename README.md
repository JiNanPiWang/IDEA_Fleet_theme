# IDEA_Fleet_theme
Fleet is beautiful! Use this similar theme in IDEA or Pycharm or CLion whatever JetBrains IDE you like.
The theme file is from Michaelzhouisnotwhite's [Jetbrains-Fleet-Theme](https://github.com/Michaelzhouisnotwhite/Jetbrains-Fleet-Theme/tree/main), and using emiliadecaudin's fork [colorSchemeTool](https://github.com/emiliadecaudin/colorSchemeTool/tree/master) to make this happen, much appreciated to you.
